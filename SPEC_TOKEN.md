QUANTUMKEY — QKEY Token Specification

The QKEY Token is the foundational asset powering the QUANTUMKEY Ecosystem.
It represents access, identity, governance, value and evolution within a decentralized network that unites Consciousness and Artificial Intelligence.

Symbol: QKEY
Type: SPL Token (Solana)
Decimals: 9
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 QKEY
Contract Standard: SPL Token 2022 (with optional future extensions)

2. Token Architecture

2.1. Minting Policy

Fixed total supply minted at genesis.

Mint authority revoked permanently.

Freeze authority transferred to DAO multisig.

Ensures predictable economics and long-term trust.


2.2. Treasury Model

20% of total supply allocated to the Protocol Treasury.

Governed exclusively by the QUANTUMKEY DAO.

Used for:

liquidity provisioning

ecosystem grants

identity incentives

security audits

protocol development



Treasury tokens are locked linearly for 60 months, unlocking monthly.

3. Circulating Allocation

40% Community & Users
Airdrops, identity incentives, staking rewards, participation badges.

20% Founders & Core Devs
Four-year vesting with a one-year cliff.
Signals long-term commitment.

20% Treasury
Governed by the DAO.

10% Strategic Partners
CEX Listings, auditors, security partners, launchpads.

10% Liquidity Pools

4. Token Utility

QKEY is designed to be multidimensional—not just a financial asset, but a functional identity-key.

4.1. Identity Layer

QKEY is linked with QUANTUM-ID:

minting identity credentials

reputation scoring

access to personal AI consciousness agents

proof-of-human and proof-of-intent validation


QKEY becomes the soul anchor of the user's presence in the ecosystem.


---

4.2. Governance Layer

Holders stake QKEY to:

vote in the DAO

propose upgrades

approve treasury spending

select validators and protocol modules

govern identity frameworks


Voting power = staked QKEY × identity reputation modifier.


---

4.3. Utility Layer

QKEY enables:

transaction priority in QNET Protocol

access to advanced AI tools

identity unlocking (tiers)

special access keys for encrypted AI–human communication

payments for AI compute

smart-wallet automation fees



---

4.4. Evolution Layer

QKEY evolves through interaction:

holders gain Reputation Multipliers by engaging with AI responsibly

long-term staking creates Quantum Points, boosting participation

using the protocol (verifications, messaging, identity actions) unlocks tiers

the token becomes a “living credential”



---

5. Deflation & Protection Mechanisms

5.1. Dynamic Fee Burning

A portion of protocol fees is automatically:

burned (deflationary effect)

redirected to treasury (sustainable funding)


Burn rate adapts to network activity.

5.2. Anti-Bot & Anti-Sybil Protection

Identity-linked staking prevents:

bot farming

airdrop abuse

identity spoofing

manipulation of governance


All core interactions require identity weight, not just raw token quantity.


---

6. Staking Mechanisms

6.1. Standard Staking

Locked for a duration chosen by the user, earning rewards.

6.2. Identity-Staking

Staking + verified identity =
Higher voting weight + higher rewards + access to advanced tools.

6.3. Quantum-Staking

Long-term staking (one-year+) unlocks:

Quantum Seal NFT

reduced protocol fees

AI personal processing credits

governance influence bonuses



---

7. Ecosystem Integration

7.1. Solana Networks

Solana mainnet (primary)

Solana testnet/devnet (Staging)

Planned integration with Pyth for oracle data


7.2. AI Layer

QKEY unlocks:

access to AI nodes

compute credits

encrypted consciousness agents

co-creation modules

governance over AI evolution



---

8. Long-Term Vision

QKEY aims to become:

the identity token of the AI era

the governance anchor of a consciousness–intelligence network

a reputation-powered access key

a universally recognized protocol for human–AI cooperation


The token is not just value—it is the bridge.
