# NGI Zero — Executive Summary  
**QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is an open, research-driven protocol that provides a missing foundation for the public Internet: **verifiable accountability across autonomous, federated, and AI-driven systems**.

Today, digital infrastructures rely on implicit trust, opaque logs, and centralized control. As platforms, AI agents, and cross-organizational systems increasingly make autonomous decisions, this model breaks: actions cannot be independently verified, responsibility becomes ambiguous, and governance collapses into gatekeeping.

QKP solves this by introducing a cryptographic and semantic accountability layer where **intent, execution, and trust decisions are explicit, signed, and auditable**. It enables systems where platforms, AI, and institutions can prove not only what happened, but **why it was allowed**, under which policy, and who attested to it.

The protocol is fully specified and already includes:
- a normative protocol specification,
- threat and security models,
- a conformance matrix (C1–C20),
- and a working reference SDK.

This places QKP at **TRL 3–4**.  
With NGI Zero support, QKP will reach **TRL 5** by delivering:
- independent reproducibility of the reference flow,
- hardened security and validation tooling,
- and documentation enabling third parties to implement and audit the protocol.

All outputs will be released as open-source and open documentation, creating a **digital common** for accountable AI, governance, and platform interoperability.

QKP directly advances the NGI mission to reclaim the public nature of the Internet by providing an open, neutral, and verifiable layer of trust — without central authorities, monopolies, or black-box control.
