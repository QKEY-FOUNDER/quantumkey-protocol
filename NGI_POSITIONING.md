## 1. Purpose

This document translates the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) into the evaluation language of the NGI Zero / NLnet Commons Fund.

It does not modify the protocol.
It defines how QKP aligns with the goals of a public, open, trustworthy Internet.

---

## 2. NGI Vision Alignment

NGI Zero funds technologies that:

- strengthen digital commons
- decentralize control
- increase trust, transparency, and sovereignty
- enable open, interoperable infrastructures

QuantumKey Protocol directly addresses these goals by providing:

- cryptographic accountability without central authority
- verifiable intent and trust decisions
- federated, policy-driven governance primitives
- auditability across autonomous and cross-organizational systems

QKP enables a future where:
- platforms are accountable
- AI systems are auditable
- governance is transparent
- trust does not depend on gatekeepers

This aligns with NGI’s mission to reclaim the public nature of the Internet.

## 3. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

Current status: **TRL 3–4**

QKP has:

- a full normative protocol specification
- security and threat models
- conformance matrix (C1–C20)
- reference flows
- a working reference SDK

This corresponds to:
> “Experimental proof of concept validated in laboratory conditions”

NGI funding would allow QKP to reach **TRL 5**:
> “Technology validated in relevant environment with independent reproducibility”

---

## 4. Public Value & Commons Impact

QKP creates a **public accountability layer** for the Internet.

It enables:
- verifiable governance
- transparent AI decision trails
- cross-platform trust without monopolies
- auditability without centralized logs

All outputs are:
- open-source
- license-free to use
- reusable by any organization or government

QKP is infrastructure for **digital sovereignty and democratic oversight**.

---

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Progress is measured by:

- Number of conformance tests passing (C1–C20)
- Number of independent reproductions of the reference flow
- Number of third-party implementations
- Number of verified accountability chains generated
- Documentation completeness & auditability

These KPIs map directly to NGI Zero’s requirement for measurable public value.

## 6. Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Semantic or protocol ambiguity | Formal specification + canonical examples |
| Security flaws | Threat model + security invariants |
| Lack of adoption | Open reference SDK + documentation |
| Complexity | Tooling + reference flows |

QKP is designed to surface failures explicitly rather than hide them.

---

## 7. Why NGI Zero Is the Right Fit

QKP is not a startup product.
It is a **public protocol**.

NGI Zero exists to fund exactly this category:
- high-risk
- high-impact
- open
- infrastructure-level research

Without NGI, QKP risks being captured by private interests.
With NGI, it can remain a digital common.
