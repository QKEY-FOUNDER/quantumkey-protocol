## 1. Purpose

This document defines how the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) produces **continuous, machine-verifiable evidence** of research and development activity.

Its purpose is to make QKP:
- SIFIDE compliant
- NGI/Horizon auditable
- scientifically reproducible
- regulator-readable

This is not documentation.  
This is an **evidence factory**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

QKP does not report progress.  
QKP **proves progress**.

Every research hypothesis, every cryptographic primitive, every semantic validator must produce:
- artifacts
- hashes
- test results
- divergence metrics

If it cannot be verified, it does not exist.

---

## 3. What Counts as Experimental Evidence

In QKP, the following are legally valid R&D artifacts:

| Artifact | Evidence Type |
|--------|----------------|
| reference-flow.js | Functional prototype |
| conformance-c*.js | Experimental test suite |
| SDK modules | Component prototypes |
| security invariants | Formal safety hypotheses |
| validator outputs | Semantic experiment results |
| flow hashes | Reproducibility proofs |

These satisfy ANI and EU definitions of **experimental development**.

---

## 4. Evidence Pipeline

Each execution of:

node examples/reference-flow.js  

produces:

- QIE objects  
- Semantic signatures  
- Acceptance receipts  
- Hashes  
- Causal graphs  

Each conformance run produces:
- pass/fail metrics
- divergence data
- regression signals

These are written into:

/evidence/YYYY-MM-DD/

forming a legally auditable R&D trail.

---

## 5. What ANI Auditors Can Verify

An auditor can:
- replay any flow
- recompute hashes
- verify signatures
- confirm that results were not altered
- correlate activity with declared hypotheses

This is **better than lab notebooks**.

---

## 6. Link to Research Program

Each experiment maps to:
- hypotheses in QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md
- risks
- mitigation paths

Nothing is random.  
Everything is scientific.

---

## 7. Link to TRL

Every successful:
- conformance run
- multi-validator run
- federated replay

pushes QKP up the TRL ladder.

TRL is computed from evidence, not claimed.

---

## 8. Why This Is Unique

Most projects produce:
PowerPoints.

QKP produces:
- hashes
- signed flows
- executable proof

This is what EU evaluators dream of.

---

## 9. Legal & Fiscal Power

Because evidence is:
- immutable
- time-stamped
- reproducible
- linked to experiments

It qualifies as:
- SIFIDE I&D proof
- Horizon R&D reporting
- NGI milestone evidence
- auditor-grade technical trace

---

## 10. Final Statement

QKP is not a research claim.

It is a **research machine**.

It converts:
code → evidence → funding → science

This engine is what turns the QuantumKey Protocol into a permanent R&D organism.
