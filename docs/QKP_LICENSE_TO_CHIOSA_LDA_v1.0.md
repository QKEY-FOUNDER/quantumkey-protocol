## 1. Purpose

This document formally grants **CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA** the right to act as the **official Research & Development operator** of the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP).

Its purpose is to establish a clear, auditable, and legally coherent bridge between:

- the **scientific and academic authority** of QKP  
- and the **institutional and fiscal capacity** of a Portuguese legal entity  

This enables lawful participation in:

- SIFIDE II  
- European R&D funding (NGI, Horizon, etc.)  
- academic–industry partnerships  
- prototype development  
- fiscal and audit frameworks  

without compromising the sovereignty or integrity of the protocol.

## 3. What is Licensed

The following is licensed to CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA for Research & Development purposes:

- the QuantumKey Protocol specifications  
- the academic baseline (Baseline v0.1 and future frozen baselines)  
- the SDK and reference implementations  
- the reference flows and conformance framework  
- the research program and experimental plans  

The license covers:

- scientific research  
- experimental development  
- prototyping  
- internal and external testing  
- grant applications  
- fiscal incentive programs  
- technical partnerships  

---

## 4. What is NOT Transferred

This license **does not** transfer:

- ownership of the QuantumKey Protocol  
- authorship  
- protocol governance  
- control of baselines  
- the Zenodo DOI or academic anchoring  
- trademark or brand ownership  

The QuantumKey Protocol remains an **independent, sovereign scientific artifact**.

---

## 5. Relationship to Zenodo and the Academic Baseline

The **academic baseline** of QKP is anchored via Zenodo with DOI:

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18172464  

This DOI represents the **immutable scholarly reference**.

CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA operates on top of this baseline as a **research-performing organization**, not as the owner of the protocol.

All research, prototypes, and experimental outputs produced by CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA must remain compatible with the frozen baseline unless a new baseline is formally declared.

---

## 6. R&D and Fiscal Positioning

All work performed by CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA on QKP is classified as:

- experimental development  
- applied research  
- software and cryptographic R&D  

This qualifies the activity for:

- SIFIDE II (Portugal)  
- ANI technical evaluation  
- European R&D programs  

because QKP explicitly operates under:

- technical uncertainty  
- hypothesis-driven research  
- experimental validation  
- reproducible test suites  

as defined in the QKP Research Program.

---

## 7. Independence of the Protocol

CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA may:

- build prototypes  
- run testnets  
- apply for grants  
- hire researchers  
- publish results  

But it may not:

- change the protocol baseline  
- redefine QKP semantics  
- represent itself as the owner of QKP  

without an explicit protocol-level governance process.

---

## 8. Term and Scope

This license is:

- perpetual  
- non-exclusive  
- global  
- royalty-free for research and development  

It exists solely to enable lawful and effective institutional research around QKP.

---

## 9. Final Declaration

QuantumKey Protocol is a scientific and technical framework.

CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA is its institutional research vessel.

They are aligned — but not conflated.
