# QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)

QKP is a protocol for verifiable accountability across autonomous and federated systems.

This page is a minimal public index for the QuantumKey Protocol.  
It does not duplicate the specification or whitepaper. It points to canonical sources.

## Choose your path

QuantumKey Protocol can be approached from different perspectives.
Select the path that best matches your intent.

### 👩‍💻 Builders & Engineers
If you want to **see QKP in action** and build with it:

- Run the executable reference flow  
  `examples/reference-flow.js`

- Follow the annotated walkthrough  
  `examples/REFERENCE_FLOW.md`

- Explore the core SDK primitives  
  `src/graph/` · `src/identity/` · `src/claims/` · `src/execution/` · `src/policy/`

---

### 🧠 Researchers & Architects
If you want to **understand why QKP exists and how it is designed**:

- Read the Whitepaper  
  `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`

- Study the normative protocol specification  
  `docs/protocol-spec.md`

- Review the technical cross-reference map  
  Appendix B — `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`

---

### 🛡️ Governance Designers & Auditors
If you want to **evaluate trust, accountability, and governance separation**:

- Review conformance coverage  
  `docs/conformance.md`

- Inspect the acceptance and attestation layer  
  `src/policy/`

- Examine end-to-end trust cases  
  `examples/conformance-c19.js`  
  `examples/conformance-c20.js`
