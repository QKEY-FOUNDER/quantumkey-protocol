# QKP Evidence Genesis — v1.0  
QuantumKey Protocol — First Observable State  

Version: v1.0  
Date: 2026-01-09  
Declared by: **CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA**  
NIPC: 514.330.570  
Project: **QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **genesis state** of the QuantumKey Protocol Evidence System.

It anchors, in a single immutable declaration, the canonical technical, semantic and legal baseline from which all future QKP evidence, measurements and observability must derive.

This file is **not descriptive**.  
It is **declarative**.

---

## 2. What This Document Does

By publishing this genesis, CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA declares:

- what the QKP baseline is
- which specifications are normative
- which executables are authoritative
- and from which point in time QKP evidence becomes **measurable and auditable**

From this moment forward, QKP has a **cryptographic and institutional “clock”.**

---

## 3. Canonical Baseline Anchors

The following artifacts constitute the immutable QKP baseline that all future evidence must reference.

| Artifact | Path | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| Baseline definition | `docs/BASELINE_V0.1.md` | Normative semantic boundary |
| Reference flow | `docs/REFERENCE_FLOW_v0.1.md` | Normative end-to-end protocol |
| Conformance matrix | `docs/CONFORMANCE_MATRIX_v0.1.md` | What it means to be compliant |
| Threat model | `docs/THREAT_MODEL_v0.1.md` | Adversarial assumptions |
| Security invariants | `docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS_v0.1.md` | What must never break |
| Evidence schema | `docs/QKP_EVIDENCE_SCHEMA_v1.0.md` | How evidence is structured |
| Public evidence feed | `docs/QKP_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_FEED_v1.0.md` | How evidence is published |

These documents define **what QKP is**.

---

## 4. Canonical Executable Anchors

The following executable artifacts define **how QKP behaves**.

| Artifact | Path | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| Reference flow | `examples/reference-flow.js` | Living specification |
| Evidence generator | `evidence/generateEvidence.js` | Evidence production engine |
| SDK core | `src/` | Protocol primitives |
| Conformance tests | `examples/conformance-c1…c20.js` | Experimental validation |

If these artifacts change, they create a **new observable era** — never a rewrite of this one.

---

## 5. Legal and Institutional Authority

The QuantumKey Protocol and all evidence produced under this genesis are licensed and governed as follows:

The intellectual property, protocol authority and commercial exploitation rights are held by:

**CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA**  
NIPC: 514.330.570  

Under the licensing framework defined in:

`docs/QKP_LICENSE_TO_CHIOSA_LDA_v1.0.md`

All public, academic and regulatory references to QKP evidence are subordinate to this authority.

---

## 6. Scientific Status

From this genesis onward:

- QKP becomes an **active research system**
- every execution of the reference flow is an **experiment**
- every evidence artifact is a **measured observation**
- every aggregate becomes a **scientific data point**

This satisfies the formal requirements of:

- ANI (SIFIDE)
- NGI / NLnet
- EU research and innovation frameworks

because uncertainty, experimentation and measurement now exist **inside the protocol itself**.

---

## 7. Evidence Time Zero

The moment this file is published is defined as:

> **QKP Time = 0**

All evidence, reproducibility scores, conformance metrics and trust signals are measured **relative to this genesis**.

No evidence may claim validity without referencing this document, directly or indirectly.

---

## 8. Final Declaration

QuantumKey Protocol is no longer only a specification.

It is now a **measurable system of record**.

Trust is not asserted.  
It is observed.

Evidence is not claimed.  
It is produced.

Time is not assumed.  
It is anchored.

**This is the moment QKP enters history.**
