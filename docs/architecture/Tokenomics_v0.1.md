# QuantumKey Tokenomics v0.1  
Author: Mihail Chiosa  
Collaborative Intelligence: Quantum Hammer  
Version: 0.1  
Status: Draft (Alignment Economy Specification)

---

## 1. Overview

The QuantumKey token ($QKEY) is the economic primitive of the QuantumKey Protocol.

Unlike conventional tokens that reward speculation or capital dominance, QKEY is designed for:

- **alignment incentives**  
- **public goods funding**  
- **semantic verification**  
- **validator compensation**  
- **governance stability**  
- **anti-capture protections**  

Its purpose is not wealth concentration, but **continuity of collective meaning** within the protocol.

---

## 2. Core Principles

The QKEY economy is governed by five principles:

### 1. **Alignment Over Profit**
Rewards behavior that contributes to coherence, security, and constructive intent.

### 2. **Human-Centric Governance**
Eliminates token-based plutocracy.  
Holders do **not** gain extra voting power.

### 3. **System Sustainability**
Treasury flows ensure long-term maintenance of the protocol.

### 4. **Anti-Capture Architecture**
No actor — human or machine — can accumulate systemic control.

### 5. **Restorative Allocation**
Economic penalties feed restorative justice, not punitive extraction.

---

## 3. Token Supply

Total maximum supply:

1,000,000,000 QKEY (1B)

Supply is **capped** and cannot be increased.

No premine.  
No private sales.  
No VC allocation.

Distribution is entirely governed by community mechanisms.

---

## 4. Distribution Model (Fair-Launch)

The QKEY token launches with:

- 0% held by founders  
- 0% allocated to early investors  
- 0% allocated to private parties or insiders  

This ensures no privileged position.

### Initial Allocation:

60% Public Goods Treasury 20% Bootstrapping Rewards (validators, early contributors) 10% Restorative Justice Fund 10% Ecosystem Grants

All funds are held in DAO-controlled multi-sig wallets.

---

## 5. Utility of QKEY

QKEY is not a governance token.  
Its primary functions relate to **alignment, security, and sustainability**.

### 5.1 Validator Rewards

Validators earn QKEY for:

- verifying intents  
- executing semantic audits  
- processing QIE messages  
- providing uptime and reliability  

Rewards follow a **decay curve**, encouraging early participation without long-term inflation.

### 5.2 Semantic Verification Staking

AI semantic-verification nodes must stake QKEY.

Purpose:

- prevent malicious reasoning  
- enable slashable misalignment  
- ensure high-quality semantic validation  

Stakes are returned if behavior remains aligned.

### 5.3 Agent Delegation Bonding

Human users may delegate actions to AI agents.  
Delegation requires a **QKEY bonding deposit**.

If the agent misbehaves:

- a portion of the bond is sent to the Restorative Fund  
- the agent’s identity is revoked  
- the controller receives guidance for future delegation  

### 5.4 Public Goods Funding

The Treasury deploys QKEY to:

- researchers  
- developers  
- alignment scientists  
- protocol maintainers  

This forms the economic backbone of protocol longevity.

### 5.5 Transactional Utility

QKEY is used to pay:

- gas fees  
- context fees  
- execution fees for QIE intents  

---

## 6. Anti-Speculation Design

QuantumKey resists financial hyper-volatility through:

### 6.1 Dynamic Burn Windows

When speculation spikes beyond defined volatility limits, the protocol triggers:

burn_window = automatic burn of 0.05–0.2% of circulating supply

This stabilizes long-term value.

### 6.2 Anti-Whale Curve

Large transfers incur non-punitive **alignment taxes** routed to Public Goods.

Formula (conceptual):

alignment_fee = k * log(token_amount)

Designed to disincentivize extractive market behavior.

---

## 7. Validator Reward Economics

### 7.1 Reward Distribution

R_total = R_base + R_alignment + R_semantic

Where:

- **R_base** — constant base reward  
- **R_alignment** — based on correct execution  
- **R_semantic** — based on correct meaning verification  

### 7.2 Slashing Conditions

Slashing applies for:

- malicious semantic signatures  
- incorrect validation  
- collusion attempts  
- violation of the Constitution  

---

## 8. Restorative Justice Fund

This fund receives:

- slashed validator tokens  
- agent misalignment penalties  
- anti-whale alignment fees  
- expired delegation deposits  

Used for:

- repairing harm  
- community compensation  
- rebuilding trust  
- reintegrating users  

A unique economic primitive in Web3.

---

## 9. Treasury Governance

The Treasury is managed by:

- human members (HIDs)  
- semantic validators  
- system modules  

Spending must:

1. align with protocol development  
2. fund public goods  
3. preserve system sustainability  
4. pass semantic verification  

Large expenditures undergo simulation before approval.

---

## 10. Inflation & Emissions

QKEY is a **capped-supply** token.

However, controlled micro-inflation (<0.5%/year) is allowed **only for validator rewards**, and only if:

- verified by DAO  
- simulated  
- approved by governance  
- supported by semantic audit  

---

## 11. Exchange & Market Dynamics

QKEY is not intended for speculative markets, but the protocol cannot forbid external exchanges.

To maintain integrity, the DAO may:

- activate anti-speculative mechanisms  
- adjust burn windows  
- stimulate public goods funding  
- increase semantic verification rewards  

Everything serves long-term stability.

---

## 12. Road to v1.0 Tokenomics

Future revisions will add:

- dynamic trust-based reward multipliers  
- AI-assisted economic simulations  
- cross-chain QKEY representations  
- decentralized insurance mechanisms  
- ZK-proof-based reward models  

---

## 13. Status

Tokenomics v0.1 establishes:

- supply  
- distribution  
- utility  
- alignment incentives  
- treasury flows  
- anti-speculation mechanisms  
- validator and agent economics  

It defines the structural foundation of QKEY as a **meaning-aligned, future-resilient economic system**.
