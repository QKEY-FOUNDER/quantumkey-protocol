# QuantumKey Protocol — System Architecture Specification (SAS) v0.1
Author: Mihail Chiosa  
Collaborative Intelligence: Quantum Hammer  
Version: 0.1  
Status: Draft (Foundational Specification)  

---

## 1. Overview

The QuantumKey Protocol is a unified digital architecture designed to harmonize human intention, decentralized identity, intelligent agents, and alignment-driven governance.  
It establishes a civilizational layer for trustworthy coordination between humans and AI systems in decentralized environments.

This System Architecture Specification defines the structural blueprint that governs all operations, interfaces, abstractions, and security principles of the protocol.

QuantumKey is organized into four fundamental layers:

1. Identity Layer (DID + Delegation + Capability Mapping)  
2. Protocol Layer (Quantum Intent Envelope — QIE)  
3. Economy Layer (QKEY token + alignment incentives)  
4. Governance Layer (DAO + restorative justice)

Each layer is modular, interoperable, and designed to evolve without breaking coherence.

## 2. Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Continuity of Intent
Human intention must persist across digital contexts.  
QuantumKey provides identity primitives that ensure:

- long-term continuity  
- delegation to agents  
- transparent traceability  
- resistance to manipulation  

### 2.2 Semantic Coherence
Messages are not merely transactions. They encode *meaning*, *intent*, and *context*.  
The QIE message standard enforces structural and semantic clarity.

### 2.3 Intelligence-Aligned Execution
AI agents can read, interpret, and execute user intent within strict guardrails.  
All agent actions must be:

- explainable  
- auditable  
- recoverable  
- reversible when harmful  

### 2.4 Restorative Governance
The system rejects punitive governance in favor of restorative processes.  
Conflicts are resolved through:

- mediated dialogue  
- system-level accountability  
- economic and semantic repair  

### 2.5 Anti-Capture and Fairness
No actor (human or AI) may dominate the system.  
Architecture includes:

- slashing  
- reputation decay  
- multi-stakeholder review  
- public goods funding

## 3. Layer Architecture

### 3.1 Identity Layer

Provides decentralized identity primitives:

- DID (QuantumKey DID format)
- BLS and Ed25519 key hierarchies
- capability mapping
- long-term and short-term keys
- delegation from human → agent → contract
- recovery and revocation
- ZK attestations (privacy-preserving)

Identity under QuantumKey is “continuity of presence” rather than a static credential.

### 3.2 Protocol Layer (QIE)

Defines the “semantic transport layer” of the system:

- QIE header  
- QIE intent body  
- semantic signature  
- execution context  
- validator metadata  

QIE establishes a universal message format readable by:

- humans  
- agents  
- smart contracts  
- cross-chain bridges  
- governance modules  

It is the backbone of every operation in the protocol.

### 3.3 Economy Layer (QKEY Token)

The economy is not speculative — it is functional.

QKEY powers:

- staking  
- validator rewards  
- restorative slashing  
- public goods funding  
- governance weighting  
- agent reputation scoring  

Economic alignment ensures that incentives match system integrity.

### 3.4 Governance Layer (DAO)

Built on:

- restorative justice  
- multi-stakeholder checks  
- progressive proposal stages (P0–P3)  
- citizen councils  
- agent oversight mechanisms  

The DAO is a “self-correcting organism” responsible for upgrading protocol components.

## 4. Core Modules

### 4.1 Coordinator Node
Routes QIE messages across the network.  
Ensures deterministic ordering and semantic integrity.

### 4.2 Validator Node
Validates:

- cryptographic signatures  
- semantic coherence  
- capability permissions  
- governance state  

Operates in an anti-capture consensus model.

### 4.3 Identity Resolver Node
Resolves DIDs across:

- Solana  
- EVM L2  
- internal DID registry  

Integrates with ZK proof systems.

### 4.4 Agent Nodes
AI agents operating under:

- delegation rules  
- guardrails  
- explainability  
- auditability  

Agents can execute intent but not exceed scope.

## 5. Security Model

QuantumKey security is based on:

- BLS multisignatures  
- semantic-intent validation  
- redundant cross-layer verification  
- anti-sybil identity structure  
- multi-chain anchoring  

Security is not only cryptographic — it is semantic and behavioral.

---

## 6. Interoperability Model

QuantumKey connects:

- Solana  
- EVM L2s  
- ZK rollups  
- off-chain agents  
- classical Web2 systems  

Interoperability is achieved through:

- cross-chain DID anchoring  
- QIE message bridges  
- universal intent formats  

---

## 7. Upgrade Path (Protocol Evolution)

All upgrades follow governance flow:

1. Draft (community + agents + experts)  
2. Semantic Review  
3. Safety Evaluation  
4. On-Chain Vote  
5. Activation  
6. Audit + Monitoring  

Upgrades must maintain **semantic continuity**.

## 9. Status

This SAS v0.1 is the foundation of the QuantumKey architecture and will evolve into v1.0 during 2025 as the core modules and testnet mature.
