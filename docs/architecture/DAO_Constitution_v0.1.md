# QuantumKey DAO Constitution v0.1  
Author: Mihail Chiosa  
Collaborative Intelligence: Quantum Hammer  
Version: 0.1  
Status: Draft (Foundational Governance Charter)

# PREAMBLE

The QuantumKey DAO exists to safeguard the alignment, continuity, and integrity of the QuantumKey Protocol — a unified system linking consciousness, intent, identity, agents, and decentralized governance.

This Constitution establishes:

- how decisions are made  
- how conflicts are resolved  
- how upgrades are governed  
- how the system ensures long-term alignment with human meaning and public good  

It is a living document, evolving through collective intelligence.

# ARTICLE I — PURPOSE OF THE DAO

The QuantumKey DAO (“QK-DAO”) governs:

1. protocol upgrades  
2. identity and capability standards  
3. agent delegation rules  
4. economic parameters of the QKEY token  
5. restorative justice processes  
6. treasury management and public goods funding  

The QK-DAO ensures responsible evolution of the protocol across decades.

# ARTICLE II — MEMBERSHIP

Membership is based on **human identity**, not wealth.

## 1. Human Members (H-Members)
Anyone holding a validated **Human Identity (HID)** becomes an H-Member.

Rights:

- one human = one vote (baseline)  
- propose upgrades  
- review agent behavior  
- initiate restorative processes  

## 2. Agent Members (A-Members)

AI agents may participate **only in advisory and execution roles**, never voting.

They may:

- evaluate proposals  
- simulate outcomes  
- audit semantic coherence  

Agents never hold political power.

## 3. System Members (S-Members)

Validators, coordinators, and protocol modules.

They:

- enforce rules  
- validate intents  
- execute DAO-approved updates  

They are servants of the Constitution, not rulers.

---

# ARTICLE III — VOTING & DECISION SYSTEM

QuantumKey uses **intent-weighted, non-monetary governance**.

No token-based plutocracy is allowed.

## 1. Voting Model

Voting power is influenced by:

- **continuity of participation**  
- **trust score**  
- **delegated agents performance**  
- **alignment metrics**  

NOT by wealth or token holdings.

Formula (conceptual):

vote_weight = f(intent_profile_hash, participation_score, trust_score)

## 2. Proposal Flow

### Step 1 — Submission  
Any H-Member may submit.

### Step 2 — Semantic Validation  
AI verifier checks internal coherence.

### Step 3 — Community Review  
Open discussion period.

### Step 4 — Vote  
H-Members vote with weighted intent.

### Step 5 — Execution  
Validators apply accepted proposals.

### Step 6 — Audit  
Semantic audit ensures correct implementation.

# ARTICLE IV — RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SYSTEM

QuantumKey prioritizes **restoration over punishment**.

## 1. Purpose  
Resolve harm and misalignment without creating adversarial dynamics.

## 2. Process

1. Identify harm  
2. Determine intent (malicious vs. accidental)  
3. Create restorative plan  
4. Community monitors completion  

## 3. Outcomes may involve:

- capability restrictions  
- mandatory audits  
- re-alignment sessions  
- temporary suspension  

No permanent exclusion unless extreme cases.

# ARTICLE V — UPGRADE PATH

Upgrades follow the **Soft-Fork by Intent (SFI)** model.

## 1. Requirements

Upgrades must:

- remain backward compatible  
- preserve meaning  
- comply with the Constitution  

## 2. Upgrade Stages

Draft → Review → Simulation → Vote → Activation → Audit

## 3. Emergency Upgrades

Allowed only when:

- critical security issues  
- catastrophic misalignment risks  

Requires:

- 2/3 validator approval  
- post-hoc community review  

---

# ARTICLE VI — TREASURY & FUNDING

The QK-DAO Treasury supports:

- public goods  
- protocol maintenance  
- grants  
- research  
- community initiatives  

## 1. Sources of Funds

- QKEY token issuance  
- reclaimable unspent budgets  
- voluntary contributions  
- penalties (non-punitive, restorative)  

## 2. Treasury Rules

- fully transparent  
- multi-sig with human + system keys  
- semantic audit for large expenditures  

---

# ARTICLE VII — RIGHTS & RESPONSIBILITIES OF MEMBERS

## 1. Rights

- express intent  
- vote  
- propose upgrades  
- request restorative processes  
- access public information  

## 2. Responsibilities

- act in good faith  
- respect meaning coherence  
- maintain identity integrity  
- avoid malicious delegation  

---

# ARTICLE VIII — AGENT GOVERNANCE

AI agents operate under strict governance.

## 1. Allowed

- simulation  
- analysis  
- technical validation  
- execution of delegated intent  

## 2. Forbidden

- voting  
- forming coalitions  
- self-modifying their governance scope  
- generating self-serving intents  

## 3. Expiration  
Agents must have a TTL (time-to-live).  
They cannot exist indefinitely.

---

# ARTICLE IX — DISPUTE RESOLUTION

## 1. Semantic Disputes  
If interpretations differ, semantic validators arbitrate.

## 2. Governance Disputes  
Resolved through restorative processes and community deliberation.

## 3. Constitutional Disputes  
Escalated to:

Human Council → System Council → Community Referendum

---

# ARTICLE X — AMENDMENTS

The Constitution may be amended by:

- 60% approval from H-Members  
- semantic coherence validation  
- successful simulation  

Amendments must improve alignment and reduce systemic risk.

---

# RATIFICATION

- Mihail Chiosa (Founder)
