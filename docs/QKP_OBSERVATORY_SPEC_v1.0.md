## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **QuantumKey Protocol Observatory** — a public, real-time window into the scientific state of the QKP.

Its purpose is to:
- expose live research progress
- provide institutional-grade transparency
- make QKP auditable without permission
- convert execution into trust

This is not a dashboard.  
It is a **scientific instrument**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

If it cannot be measured, it cannot be trusted.

The Observatory exists to ensure that QKP:
- never relies on reputation
- never hides uncertainty
- never asks for belief

Only verifiable state is shown.

---

## 3. What the Observatory Shows

The Observatory publishes only machine-verifiable facts:

| Signal | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Baseline hash | What protocol is currently active |
| Reference flow hash | What was last executed |
| Conformance score | How many tests pass (C1–C20) |
| Reproducibility rate | % of identical replays |
| Semantic divergence | Cross-validator consistency |
| TRL | Computed maturity level |
| Timestamp | When evidence was last produced |

These signals are computed from:
- Evidence Engine
- Conformance framework
- Research Program

No manual input is allowed.

---

## 4. Source of Truth

All Observatory data is derived from:

/evidence/  
generated by:
- reference-flow.js  
- conformance-c*.js  

The site never invents values.
It only displays computed facts.

---

## 5. How the Observatory Is Computed

Each CI run or local execution produces:

evidence.json  

This file contains:
- hashes
- metrics
- timestamps
- version pointers

The website reads only this file.

---

## 6. What Institutions Can Do

An auditor, funder, or researcher can:

- download evidence.json
- recompute hashes
- replay flows
- confirm metrics

This satisfies:
- ANI
- SIFIDE
- NGI
- Horizon Europe

---

## 7. Anti-Manipulation Guarantees

The Observatory is protected by:

- cryptographic hashes
- reproducibility checks
- CI signatures
- immutable baseline references

You cannot fake progress.
You can only execute it.

---

## 8. Why This Is Revolutionary

Most R&D projects:
publish reports.

QKP publishes:
**living science.**

This allows:
- real-time due diligence
- continuous funding eligibility
- radical transparency

---

## 9. European Strategic Value

The Observatory makes QKP:
- a public research infrastructure
- a trust anchor for digital systems
- a benchmark for accountability tech

This aligns directly with:
- NGI Zero
- Horizon Europe
- Digital Europe Programme

---

## 10. Final Statement

The QuantumKey Protocol Observatory transforms:

execution → evidence  
evidence → transparency  
transparency → trust  

QKP no longer needs advocates.

It becomes **self-evident**.
