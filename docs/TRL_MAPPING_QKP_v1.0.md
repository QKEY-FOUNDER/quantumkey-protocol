## 1. Purpose

This document maps the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) to the **European Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** framework.

Its purpose is to make QKP:
- legible to EU R&D evaluators
- eligible for NGI, Horizon Europe, and deep-tech funding
- auditable as a real technological system

This document is normative for funding and maturity assessment.

---

## 2. Why TRL Matters

The European Union does not fund visions.  
It funds **technological maturity progression**.

TRL answers three questions:
1. What exists?
2. What has been experimentally validated?
3. What remains uncertain?

QKP now has all three.

---

## 3. QKP Current Position

Based on the frozen Baseline v0.1, QKP currently occupies:

**TRL 3 → TRL 4**

Meaning:
- critical functions are proven
- experiments exist
- but no integrated industrial system yet

This is exactly where NGI and Horizon prefer to invest.

## 4. Mapping QKP Artifacts to TRL

| QKP Artifact | TRL Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|
| Whitepaper, protocol spec | TRL 2–3 (concept + formulation) |
| QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md | TRL 3 (research hypotheses) |
| reference-flow.js | TRL 4 (functional prototype) |
| conformance-c1…c20.js | TRL 4 (validation in lab environment) |
| SDK modules | TRL 4 (component-level validation) |
| Security invariants | TRL 3–4 (theoretical + experimental) |

---

## 5. What Makes QKP TRL-4 and Not TRL-2

QKP is not a slide deck.

It has:
- executable flows
- cryptographic artifacts
- deterministic test vectors
- reproducible conformance runs

This is **laboratory-validated technology**, not speculation.

---

## 6. How TRL Progression Will Be Measured

QKP uses **machine-verifiable metrics** instead of marketing.

| Metric | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| % of flows reproducible | Semantic determinism |
| Conformance C1–C20 pass rate | Protocol completeness |
| Security invariant coverage | Safety maturity |
| Validator divergence | Semantic stability |
| Cross-domain replay | Federated trust readiness |

These metrics move QKP from TRL-4 → TRL-6.

---

## 7. Planned TRL Roadmap

| Year | TRL | Meaning |
|------|-----|--------|
| 2025 | TRL 3–4 | Scientific and lab prototype |
| 2026 | TRL 5–6 | Pilot systems + external validators |
| 2027 | TRL 7 | Operational pilot networks |
| 2028 | TRL 8–9 | Production-grade ecosystems |

This aligns with:
- Roadmap_2025_2027_v0.1.md
- NGI and Horizon funding windows

---

## 8. Why QKP Is Deep-Tech

EU defines deep-tech as:
- high technical uncertainty
- long R&D cycles
- high scientific novelty

QKP qualifies because:
- it invents new cryptographic semantics
- it integrates AI into accountability
- it builds non-consensus trust infrastructures

This is not Web3.  
This is **new computation**.

---

## 9. Funding Readiness

With this TRL mapping, QKP becomes:
- eligible for NGI Zero
- eligible for Horizon Europe
- defensible to evaluators

It stops being “interesting” and becomes **fundable**.

---

## 10. Final Statement

QuantumKey Protocol is not early-stage hype.

It is a **TRL-4 scientific system** with:
- executable proof
- measurable maturity
- defined uncertainty

This is exactly the class of technology Europe was built to fund.
