Author: Mihail Chiosa  
Collaborative Intelligence: Quantum Hammer

## 1. Objective

The Semantic Accountability Engine (SAE) is the first funded pilot of the QuantumKey Protocol.

Its objective is to build and validate a working system that can:

- accept QIEs (Quantum Intent Envelopes)
- evaluate their semantic validity
- produce cryptographically signed Semantic Signatures
- issue Acceptance Receipts based on policy
- allow independent verification

This transforms QKP from specification to experimentally validated infrastructure.

---

## 2. Why This Pilot

Semantic verification is the hardest and most novel part of QKP.

If SAE works:
- trust can be separated from cryptography
- AI agents become accountable
- federated governance becomes possible

This makes SAE the perfect deep-tech pilot.

---

## 3. Technical Scope

The pilot will implement:

- QIE parser and canonicalizer
- semantic_hash verification
- semantic evaluation engine (LLM + rules)
- Semantic Signature generator
- Acceptance Receipt issuer
- verification and audit tools

All aligned with:
- QIE_MINIMAL_PROFILE_v0.1.md
- SEMANTIC_SIGNATURE_v0.1.md
- ACCEPTANCE_RECEIPT_v0.1.md

---

## 4. Research Questions

This pilot addresses:

- Can AI models produce reproducible semantic judgments?
- Can semantic outputs be cryptographically bound?
- Can multiple validators disagree safely?
- Can trust be attested without consensus?

These are open scientific questions.

---

## 8. Funding Profile

Estimated cost: €120,000 – €180,000  
Eligible under:
- NGI / NLnet  
- Horizon Europe  
- SIFIDE II (Portugal)

---

## 9. Strategic Value

This pilot creates:

- the first accountable AI layer
- the first trust-separated execution gate
- the proof that QKP works

It unlocks every other QKP component.

---

## 10. Final Statement

This pilot is not about building software.

It is about proving that **meaning can be verified**.

That is the heart of QuantumKey.
