# QUANTUMKEY – Tokenomics  
### The Economic Architecture of Conscious Intelligence

---

## 1. Introduction

The QKEY token is the native asset of the QUANTUMKEY ecosystem.  
It powers governance, access, validation, and the alignment of AI agents within the protocol.

QKEY is not only a currency — it is a mechanism that ensures **ethical, intelligent, and conscious behaviour** across the network.

## 2. Token Overview

- **Token name:** QUANTUMKEY  
- **Symbol:** QKEY  
- **Standard:** Solana SPL  
- **Total supply:** To be defined during Phase 2  
- **Decimals:** 9  
- **Chain:** Solana

## 3. Token Utility

### 3.1 Governance  
Token holders vote on:
- Protocol upgrades  
- Ethical framework modifications  
- Resource allocation  
- Agent certification  
- DAO decisions  

### 3.2 Intelligence Access  
QKEY unlocks access to AI modules:
- Consciousness-aligned reasoning  
- High-complexity models  
- Validator agents  
- QuantumKey APIs  

### 3.3 Staking  
Users stake QKEY to:
- Validate agents  
- Access governance power  
- Support ethical consensus  
- Earn protocol rewards  

### 3.4 Agent Validation  
AI agents must stake QKEY to operate in the network.  
Misaligned behaviour causes **slashing**, redistributing tokens to ethical validators.

### 3.5 Ecosystem Participation  
QKEY is used for:
- Computational tasks  
- On-chain identity  
- Educational modules  
- Reputation building

## 4. Distribution Model (Proposed)

A balanced model between decentralization, development and longevity:

- **40% Community & DAO** – governance, incentives, grants  
- **20% Ecosystem Expansion** – partnerships, builders, alliances  
- **20% Development Foundation** – infrastructure, research, AI evolution  
- **10% Early Contributors** – founders, architects, core creators  
- **10% Reserve** – stability pool, emergency allocation  

Distribution may evolve based on community governance.

## 5. Emission & Release Schedule

The protocol proposes **gradual unlocks**:

- DAO & Community: linear over 5 years  
- Foundation: 4-year vesting  
- Early contributors: 36-month vesting  
- Reserve: locked until DAO activation  

The goal is to avoid market shocks and align long-term incentives.

## 6. Anti-Manipulation Mechanisms

### 6.1 Ethical Weighting  
Voting power is influenced by:
- Reputation  
- Agent integrity  
- Behaviour consistency  

### 6.2 AI Guardian Validators  
Independent AI agents monitor:
- Transaction patterns  
- Manipulation risks  
- Collusion behaviour  
- Sybil attacks  

### 6.3 Staking-Based Access  
Participants must align with the protocol to unlock full utility.

---

## 7. Value Flow Model

Value flows back into the ecosystem through:
- Staking rewards  
- AI service usage  
- Educational modules  
- DAO treasury cycles  
- Agent certifications  

The protocol grows organically as more conscious and intelligent agents join.

## 8. Conclusion

The QKEY token is the economic backbone of the QUANTUMKEY ecosystem.  
It aligns incentives between humans, AI agents, and decentralized governance, ensuring a future where intelligence evolves with ethics, meaning and awareness.
