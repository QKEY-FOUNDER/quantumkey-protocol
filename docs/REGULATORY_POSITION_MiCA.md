## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **regulatory position** of the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)
with respect to the **Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)** and its related
implementing and delegated acts.

Its purpose is to:
- provide regulatory clarity
- prevent misclassification or implicit regulatory claims
- distinguish protocol design from regulated activities
- support audit, banking, and partner due diligence

This document does **not** constitute legal advice.
It is a formal declarative position of the project.

## 1. Regulatory Context

The following regulatory instruments are applicable within the European Union:

- Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCA)  
- Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/304  
- Related RTS/ITS published in February 2025  
- National implementation laws, including Portugal (Law No. 69/2025)

MiCA establishes a harmonized framework governing:
- issuance of crypto-assets
- public offers of crypto-assets
- admission to trading
- crypto-asset service providers (CASPs)

---

## 2. Scope of the QuantumKey Protocol

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is:

- a **normative protocol specification**
- a **documentation-based reference framework**
- a **set of open, auditable design rules** for verifiable accountability

QKP defines:
- intent declaration formats
- semantic evaluation structures
- trust and acceptance artifacts
- auditability and governance primitives

QKP does **not** define or operate:
- custody of crypto-assets
- execution of transactions
- intermediation services
- exchange, brokerage, or settlement
- token issuance or distribution mechanisms

---

## 3. MiCA Qualification Analysis

### 3.1 Protocol vs Regulated Activity

Under MiCA, regulatory obligations apply to:
- issuers of crypto-assets
- entities offering crypto-assets to the public
- entities providing crypto-asset services

QKP, as a **protocol specification**, does **not** fall under these categories.

QKP is comparable to:
- open technical standards
- protocol reference architectures
- documentation frameworks

It does not, by itself, constitute a regulated activity.

---

### 3.2 Crypto-Asset Issuance

At the protocol level:

- QKP does **not** issue crypto-assets
- QKP does **not** conduct public offerings
- QKP does **not** publish MiCA white papers for token issuance

If a token associated with QKP is created in the future, it will be:
- evaluated independently
- documented in a separate regulatory classification
- subject to applicable MiCA provisions

---

### 3.3 Crypto-Asset Services (CASP)

QKP does **not** act as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP).

Specifically, QKP does **not**:
- provide custody or administration of crypto-assets
- execute orders on behalf of third parties
- operate trading platforms
- provide exchange or brokerage services
- provide transfer services

Any entity using QKP to provide regulated services
does so **under its own regulatory responsibility**.

---

## 4. SDK and Implementations

The reference SDK (`qkp-sdk`) is:

- open-source software
- provided without operational services
- non-custodial by design
- non-intermediating

The SDK:
- demonstrates protocol behavior
- enables experimentation and integration
- does not constitute a regulated service

Use of the SDK in regulated contexts:
- may trigger MiCA obligations for the operator
- does not transfer regulatory responsibility to QKP

---

## 5. White Papers and Documentation

Documents published in this repository include:

- protocol specifications
- examples
- governance models
- technical references

These documents:
- are **not** MiCA crypto-asset white papers
- do **not** constitute offers to the public
- do **not** invite investment or participation in a financial product

If a MiCA white paper becomes required in the future,
it will be:
- clearly identified
- published separately
- explicitly labeled as such

---

## 6. Transitional and Grandfathering Regimes

MiCA transitional regimes (including grandfathering until July 2026)
apply to entities **already providing regulated services**.

QKP, as a protocol specification:
- does not rely on transitional regimes
- does not claim grandfathered rights
- does not operate under national exemptions

---

## 7. Jurisdictional Implementation (Portugal)

Under Portuguese law (Law No. 69/2025):

- Banco de Portugal and CMVM act as competent authorities
- regulatory obligations apply to issuers and service providers

QKP does not perform activities subject to authorization
by Banco de Portugal or CMVM.

---

## 8. Risk of Misinterpretation

To avoid regulatory ambiguity:

- QKP does not use language implying service provision
- QKP avoids terminology suggesting financial intermediation
- QKP explicitly separates protocol design from deployment

Any external deployment of QKP:
- must assess its own MiCA obligations
- must not imply protocol-level authorization

---

## 9. Ongoing Regulatory Monitoring

The QKP project commits to:

- monitoring MiCA RTS/ITS updates
- reviewing regulatory guidance from ESMA and national authorities
- updating this document if the regulatory position materially changes

Updates will be versioned and recorded in the project changelog.

---

## 10. Final Statement

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is a **protocol-level framework**, not a regulated financial actor.

MiCA applies to **activities**, not to abstract specifications.

Regulatory responsibility arises only when:
- crypto-assets are issued
- services are provided
- public offers are made

Until such activities exist, QKP remains outside the scope of MiCA authorization
requirements.

Clarity protects innovation.
Silence creates risk.
