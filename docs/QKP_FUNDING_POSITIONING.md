## 1. Purpose

This document positions the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) as a **fundable European deep-tech R&D project**.

It translates QKP’s:
- scientific program
- technical uncertainty
- experimental development
- societal impact

into the language used by:
- NGI / NLnet
- Horizon Europe
- national innovation agencies
- universities
- deep-tech investors

---

## 2. What QKP Is

QuantumKey Protocol is a **protocol-level research program** that seeks to create a new class of digital infrastructure:

> **verifiable accountability for autonomous and federated systems**

It operates at the intersection of:
- cryptography
- distributed systems
- artificial intelligence
- governance technology

This is not an application.
It is **foundational infrastructure**.

---

## 3. Why It Deserves Funding

QKP addresses a structural failure of the modern internet:

> Trust does not scale across autonomous systems.

AI agents, blockchains, cloud platforms, and governments all operate without shared, verifiable accountability.

This creates:
- security failures
- governance breakdowns
- regulatory opacity
- systemic risk

QKP introduces:
- cryptographically bound intent
- semantic verification
- attested trust decisions
- federated accountability

These are missing primitives in today’s digital society.

---

## 4. Technical Risk & Research Value

QKP involves **non-trivial technical uncertainty**:

- no existing standard for cryptographic intent
- no protocol for semantic signatures
- no system for federated accountability graphs

This makes QKP:
- too risky for product funding
- perfect for public R&D funding

This is precisely the kind of work NGI and Horizon Europe exist to support.

---

## 5. Alignment with European Values

QKP is aligned with the European vision of the internet as:

- open
- accountable
- human-centric
- federated
- trustworthy

It avoids:
- platform monopolies
- opaque AI
- centralized control
- plutocratic governance

It enables:
- digital sovereignty
- verifiable compliance
- cross-border trust
- public digital commons

---

## 6. Open Science & Open Source

All QKP outputs are:
- open specification
- open source code
- open documentation
- openly auditable

This satisfies NGI and European Commission requirements for:
> “publicly funded digital commons”

---

## 7. Measurable Outputs

QKP produces concrete deliverables:

- protocol specifications
- reference flows
- conformance tests
- SDK implementations
- audit artifacts

These are:
- testable
- reusable
- composable
- citable

---

## 8. Funding Readiness

QKP already has:
- a formal research program
- an R&D dossier
- a cost model
- an audit-ready pack
- an academic DOI

This makes it:
- low risk for funders
- high leverage for society

---

## 9. Strategic Impact

If successful, QKP enables:
- accountable AI systems
- verifiable governance
- cross-domain trust
- regulatory-grade digital evidence

This is infrastructure for:
> **the next phase of the internet.**

---

## 10. Final Position

QuantumKey Protocol is not asking for money to build a product.

It is asking for support to build:
> **a public, verifiable accountability layer for the digital world.**

That is a mission worthy of European funding.
