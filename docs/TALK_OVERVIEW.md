# QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) — Talk Overview

## The Problem We Keep Avoiding

Modern systems execute actions at scale.

They deploy code, trigger agents, automate decisions, and coordinate across organizations.
Yet when something goes wrong, we ask the same question:

> “Who do we trust?”

Logs can be modified.
Audits are retrospective.
Responsibility is inferred after the fact.

Trust becomes a social assumption, not a technical property.

---

## A Different Question

QuantumKey Protocol changes the question from:

> “Who do we trust?”

to:

> **“What can we prove?”**

Instead of assuming trust, QKP makes **intent, execution, and acceptance** independently verifiable.

---

## What QKP Is (in one minute)

QuantumKey Protocol is a protocol for **verifiable accountability** across autonomous and federated systems.

It provides:
- Canonical representations of intent
- Explicit causal links between actions
- Tamper-evident accountability chains and aggregates
- Separation between cryptographic validity and trust decisions
- Signed acceptance or rejection as first-class artifacts

No consensus.
No reputation system.
No central authority.

## Why This Matters Now

We are entering a world of:
- Autonomous agents
- AI-driven execution
- Cross-organization systems
- Increasing regulatory pressure

In this world, *intent and accountability must be provable*, not assumed.

QKP is designed for this reality.

---

## What Makes QKP Different

- It does not replace blockchains, DAOs, or AI systems
- It does not decide what should be trusted
- It does not enforce behavior

It provides **evidence**.

Evidence that can be:
- Verified independently
- Replayed over time
- Audited without re-execution
- Evaluated by different policies

---

## The Core Insight

Trust is not a property of actors.

It is a **verifiable outcome of structure**.

QuantumKey Protocol treats accountability as a protocol primitive.

---

## How It Is Used

In practice, QKP allows systems to:

- Declare intent explicitly
- Bind actions to identities
- Record execution as evidence
- Aggregate accountability across domains
- Evaluate trust without mutating history

All of this is demonstrated in the executable reference flow.

---

## The State of the Protocol

- Protocol version: v1.0 (frozen)
- Conformance: C1–C20 passing
- Governance: minimal, explicit, non-centralized
- Reference implementation: complete

This is not a proposal.
It is a working protocol.

---

## Closing

QuantumKey Protocol does not ask you to trust it.

It asks you to verify it.

That is the difference.
