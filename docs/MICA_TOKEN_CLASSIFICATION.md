# MICA_TOKEN_CLASSIFICATION — QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)

Status: Declarative (Pre-Issuance)  
Regulatory Framework: EU MiCA (Regulation (EU) 2023/1114)  
Jurisdictional Focus: European Union / Portugal

## 0. Purpose

This document provides a **preliminary regulatory classification framework**
for any **token potentially associated** with the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP),
in accordance with the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA).

It exists to:
- prevent implicit or accidental token qualification
- guide future design decisions
- support regulatory, banking, and partner due diligence

This document does **not** announce, authorize, or confirm the issuance of any token.

---

## 1. Current Status

As of the date of this document:

- No crypto-asset has been issued by the QKP project
- No public offer of tokens has been made
- No admission to trading has occurred

Any reference to a future token is **purely hypothetical** and non-binding.

---

## 2. MiCA Token Categories (Overview)

Under MiCA, crypto-assets may fall into the following categories:

1. **Asset-Referenced Tokens (ART)**  
2. **E-Money Tokens (EMT)**  
3. **Other Crypto-Assets** (including utility-type tokens)

Certain crypto-assets may also fall under **financial instrument regulations**
(e.g., MiFID II) instead of MiCA.

---

## 3. Preliminary Exclusion Analysis

Based on the conceptual scope of QKP:

### 3.1 Asset-Referenced Tokens (ART)

A QKP-related token is **not expected** to qualify as an ART because:

- It is not designed to maintain a stable value
- It is not referenced to multiple assets, currencies, or commodities
- No stabilization or reserve mechanism is defined

### 3.2 E-Money Tokens (EMT)

A QKP-related token is **not expected** to qualify as an EMT because:

- It is not intended to represent a claim on an issuer
- It is not pegged to a single fiat currency
- It is not designed as a means of payment

---

## 4. Potential Classification: Other Crypto-Asset (Utility-Type)

If a token were to be introduced in the future, the **only plausible MiCA category**
would be **“other crypto-asset”**, commonly referred to as a **utility-type token**.

Such a token, if designed, would:

- grant access to protocol-related functionality
- support governance or coordination mechanisms
- not represent ownership, profit rights, or repayment claims

---

## 5. Explicit Non-Characteristics

Any future token associated with QKP would **explicitly NOT**:

- confer equity, debt, or profit participation
- grant voting rights over a legal entity
- represent a claim on assets or cash flows
- function as a payment or settlement instrument
- promise appreciation or investment return

These exclusions are essential to avoid misclassification
under MiFID II or other financial regulations.

---

## 6. White Paper Implications (MiCA)

Under MiCA, a white paper is required when:

- a crypto-asset is offered to the public, or
- admission to trading is sought

As no token exists:

- no MiCA white paper is required
- no notification to authorities is necessary

If a token is later proposed:

- a MiCA-compliant white paper will be prepared
- classification will be re-evaluated
- competent authorities will be notified as required

---

## 7. Relationship to Protocol and SDK

Any future token will be:

- legally and conceptually separate from the protocol specification
- independent from the SDK implementation
- governed by its own regulatory documentation

The existence of QKP as a protocol does **not** imply token issuance.

---

## 8. Jurisdictional Considerations (Portugal)

Under Portuguese law (Law No. 69/2025):

- token issuers and service providers may require authorization
- classification depends on factual characteristics, not intent

QKP commits to:
- engaging with competent authorities if token issuance is contemplated
- avoiding regulatory ambiguity through advance disclosure

---

## 9. Regulatory Re-Evaluation Trigger

This document MUST be reviewed and updated if any of the following occur:

- decision to issue a token
- publication of token economics
- public communication implying token utility
- engagement with exchanges or trading venues

Until such triggers occur, this classification remains declarative only.

---

## 10. Final Statement

No crypto-asset currently exists under the QuantumKey Protocol.

This document exists to ensure that:
- future design choices remain compliant
- no implicit regulatory claims are made
- innovation proceeds without legal ambiguity

Preparation is compliance.
Silence is risk.
