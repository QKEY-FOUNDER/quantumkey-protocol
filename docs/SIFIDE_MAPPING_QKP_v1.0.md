## 1. Purpose

This document maps the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) research and development program
to the eligibility criteria of the Portuguese **SIFIDE II** tax incentive regime.

Its goal is to make QKP’s technical work:
- legally recognizable as **Investigação & Desenvolvimento (I&D)**
- auditable by the ANI (Agência Nacional de Inovação)
- monetizable as **tax credit** under Portuguese law

This document is normative for fiscal and audit purposes.

---

## 2. Legal Position of QKP

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is:

- an academic research program
- a cryptographic and software R&D project
- an experimental technology framework

It is **not**:
- a commercial product
- a financial service
- a crypto-asset
- a market-ready platform

All code and documentation are **experimental artifacts** produced as part of
a structured R&D program executed by CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA under license from the author.

## 3. Core Technical Uncertainties (SIFIDE requirement)

SIFIDE II requires the existence of **technical uncertainty**.
QKP explicitly contains unresolved scientific and engineering questions, including:

| QKP Research Area | Uncertainty |
|------------------|-------------|
| Semantic verification | Can machine interpretation of intent be made deterministic and reproducible? |
| Cryptographic PoI | Can intent be bound to meaning without ambiguity? |
| Causal graphs | Can federated accountability graphs resist adversarial composition? |
| Trust separation | Can verification and acceptance be cryptographically separated? |
| Aggregation | Can large-scale accountability remain tamper-evident and compressible? |

These are not engineering details.  
They are **open scientific problems**.

---

## 4. QKP Activities That Qualify as I&D

Under Portuguese SIFIDE law, eligible I&D includes:
- applied research
- experimental development
- prototyping
- validation under uncertainty

QKP performs all of them.

| QKP Component | SIFIDE Classification |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Whitepaper, protocol spec | Applied research |
| Research Program | Formal R&D planning |
| reference-flow.js | Experimental prototype |
| conformance-c1…c20.js | Validation experiments |
| SDK modules | Experimental engineering |
| Security invariants | Research into system integrity |
| Semantic signatures | Advanced algorithmic development |

## 5. Eligible Cost Categories

The following QKP expenses are SIFIDE-eligible when incurred by CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA:

### 5.1 Personnel
- Software engineers
- Cryptographers
- AI researchers
- Systems architects
- Scientific coordinators

Including:
- founders
- contractors
- PhDs (eligible at 120%)

### 5.2 Software & Infrastructure
- Development tools
- Cloud compute
- Test environments
- Version control
- CI pipelines (conformance tests)

### 5.3 Experimental Prototyping
- SDK development
- Reference flow execution
- Conformance harness
- Validator simulation

### 5.4 Technical Documentation
- Research Program
- Whitepaper
- Protocol specifications
- Experimental reports
- Audit packages

---

## 6. Evidence of Experimental Development

SIFIDE requires **evidence** that development occurred.
QKP produces machine-verifiable evidence:

| Evidence | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Reference flow | qkp-sdk/examples/reference-flow.js |
| Conformance tests | qkp-sdk/examples/conformance-c1…c20.js |
| Protocol baseline | quantumkey-protocol/docs/BASELINE_V0.1.md |
| Security model | quantumkey-protocol/docs/THREAT_MODEL_v0.1.md |
| Research hypotheses | quantumkey-protocol/docs/QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md |

Each of these produces:
- reproducible results
- cryptographic artifacts
- audit-grade proof

---

## 7. Why QKP Is Not Routine Development

SIFIDE excludes routine software engineering.
QKP is not routine.

QKP:
- invents new cryptographic primitives (PoI, semantic signatures)
- explores new computational models (semantic accountability)
- builds novel graph-based trust architectures
- validates open scientific hypotheses

There is no known off-the-shelf solution for what QKP attempts.

---

## 8. Fiscal Outcome

When QKP R&D is executed by CHIOSA & CHIOSA LDA:

- 32.5% of eligible costs are deductible (base rate)
- up to 50% incremental rate applies on growth
- credits can be carried forward

This can reach **~82.5% effective reimbursement** of R&D costs.

In practice:
QKP becomes financially self-amplifying.

---

## 9. Audit Readiness

This mapping is supported by:
- formal baseline
- frozen DOI
- reproducible experiments
- signed protocol artifacts
- explicit research hypotheses

This is exactly what ANI and tax auditors require.

---

## 10. Final Statement

QuantumKey Protocol is a **structured, high-uncertainty, experimental R&D program** in:
- cryptography
- semantic AI
- distributed systems
- accountability architectures

It fully qualifies for SIFIDE II under Portuguese law.

This document makes that eligibility explicit, verifiable, and defensible.
