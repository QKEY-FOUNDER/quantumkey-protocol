# QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) — Institutional Overview

## Executive Summary

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is a protocol for verifiable accountability across autonomous and federated systems.

It enables organizations to **prove intent, execution, and trust decisions** without relying on implicit trust, mutable logs, or centralized authorities.

QKP is designed for environments where accountability must remain **inspectable, auditable, and durable over time**.

---

## Why QKP Matters

Organizations increasingly operate systems that are:

- Autonomous or semi-autonomous
- Distributed across teams, vendors, or jurisdictions
- Subject to regulatory, audit, or governance requirements

Traditional approaches rely on:
- Trust in operators
- Post-hoc audits
- Centralized logging
- Informal responsibility attribution

These approaches do not scale.

QKP replaces them with **cryptographic evidence and explicit accountability structures**.

---

## What QKP Provides

QKP enables organizations to:

- Prove what was intended before an action occurred
- Attribute actions to identities and declared authorizations
- Record execution outcomes as verifiable evidence
- Separate cryptographic truth from policy acceptance
- Preserve accountability across organizational boundaries
- Audit decisions without re-execution or trust assumptions

All outcomes are recorded as **canonical, signed artifacts**.

---

## Risk & Compliance Alignment

QKP is suitable for use cases involving:

- Regulatory compliance
- Internal and external audits
- AI and automated decision systems
- Cross-organization coordination
- Long-lived contractual processes

QKP does not replace legal, regulatory, or policy frameworks.
It provides **evidence** that supports them.

---

## Governance Model

QKP governance is:

- Minimal
- Explicit
- Non-centralized
- Evidence-based

There is no permanent authority.
Protocol changes require documented proposals, review, and versioned acceptance.

The protocol core (v1.0) is formally frozen.

---

## Adoption Path

Organizations may adopt QKP at different levels:

- **Evaluation:** review specification and conformance
- **Pilot:** integrate the reference SDK
- **Production:** deploy QKP-compatible systems
- **Federation:** coordinate accountability across domains

Adoption does not require permission or registration.

---

## Assurance & Maturity

- Protocol version: v1.0 (frozen)
- Conformance coverage: C1–C20 passing
- Reference implementation: complete
- Versioning rules: explicit
- Governance snapshot: recorded

QKP is **ready for real-world evaluation and use**.

QuantumKey Protocol enables accountability without central control.

Evidence replaces assumption.  
Structure replaces trust.
