## 1. Purpose

This document is the **single entry point** for any auditor, funding body, or institutional reviewer assessing the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) as a **Research & Development (R&D)** project.

It defines:
- what to inspect
- where to find it
- how it proves scientific, technical, and fiscal eligibility

This document does not describe the protocol.  
It describes how the protocol’s **research program is proven**.

---

## 2. What QKP Is Being Audited As

QuantumKey Protocol is evaluated as:

- a **software R&D project**
- involving **cryptography, distributed systems, and semantic computing**
- with **experimental development**
- producing **novel and non-obvious results**

It is **not** audited as:
- a product
- a token
- a network
- a commercial service

## 3. Scientific Basis

The scientific and technical basis of the project is defined in:

| Evidence | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Research hypothesis | `docs/QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md` |
| Technical uncertainty | `docs/QKP_R&D_DOSSIER_SIFIDE_2025.md` |
| Threat & security models | `docs/THREAT_MODEL_v0.1.md` |
| Security invariants | `docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS_v0.1.md` |

These establish that QKP addresses unresolved technical problems.

---

## 4. Experimental Development

The experimental work is proven by:

| Evidence | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Normative flow | `docs/REFERENCE_FLOW_v0.1.md` |
| Conformance tests | `docs/CONFORMANCE_MATRIX_v0.1.md` |
| Executable experiments | `qkp-sdk/examples/` |
| Core implementations | `qkp-sdk/src/` |

These show systematic experimentation and validation.

---

## 5. Technological Novelty

The state of the art and advancement is established through:

| Evidence | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Whitepaper | `docs/WHITEPAPER.md` |
| Protocol specification | `docs/protocol-spec.md` |
| Canonical statement | `docs/CANONICAL_STATEMENT.md` |

These define what is new and why it did not exist before.

---

## 6. Fiscal Eligibility (SIFIDE)

The fiscal structure is defined in:

| Evidence | Location |
|--------|----------|
| R&D dossier | `docs/QKP_R&D_DOSSIER_SIFIDE_2025.md` |
| Cost model | `docs/QKP_COST_MODEL_2025.md` |

These map the work to SIFIDE-eligible R&D categories.

---

## 7. Traceability

Every technical artifact is traceable via:

- GitHub commit history  
- Conformance test outputs  
- Reference flow execution  
- Document versioning  

This creates a **replayable audit trail**.

---

## 8. How to Audit QKP

An auditor should:

1. Read `QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md`
2. Verify uncertainties in `QKP_R&D_DOSSIER_SIFIDE_2025.md`
3. Inspect experimental artifacts in `qkp-sdk/`
4. Verify protocol invariants in `SECURITY_INVARIANTS_v0.1.md`
5. Map costs using `QKP_COST_MODEL_2025.md`

No trust is required.  
Everything is inspectable.

---

## 9. Conclusion

QuantumKey Protocol in 2025 constitutes:

- legitimate technological R&D
- with scientific uncertainty
- experimental validation
- fiscal traceability

This pack exists so that **any independent party can verify that claim**.
