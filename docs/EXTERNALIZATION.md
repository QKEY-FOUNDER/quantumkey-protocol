# QuantumKey Protocol — Externalization Plan (v1.0)

**Status:** Active  
**Protocol Version:** v1.0  
**Scope:** Public-facing materials and discovery surfaces  
**Repository:** quantumkey-protocol

---

## Purpose

This document defines how QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is presented, referenced, and discovered externally.

Externalization does not change protocol semantics.  
It ensures **clarity, consistency, and citability** across public surfaces.

---

## Canonical Sources

The following documents are the **single sources of truth**:

- **Canonical Statement:** `docs/CANONICAL_STATEMENT.md`
- **Whitepaper:** `docs/WHITEPAPER.md`
- **Protocol Specification:** `docs/protocol-spec.md`
- **Conformance:** `docs/conformance.md`

All external materials MUST derive language and claims from these sources.

---

## Public Surfaces

QKP externalization targets the following surfaces:

1. **Repository README**  
   Entry narrative and adoption paths.

2. **Website / GitHub Pages**  
   High-level explanation, links to canonical documents.

3. **RFC-style Documentation**  
   Structured, referenceable technical docs derived from the spec.

4. **Academic & Institutional References**  
   Citations, grants, and formal reviews referencing the canonical statement.

---

## Messaging Rules

External messaging MUST:

- Avoid hype or speculative claims
- Avoid promises of adoption or value
- Avoid redefining protocol scope
- Use precise, verifiable language

External messaging MUST NOT:

- Introduce new concepts not present in the spec
- Contradict the frozen protocol semantics
- Replace evidence with opinion

---

## Citability

Any public reference to QKP SHOULD include:

- Protocol name: **QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**
- Version reference: **v1.0**
- Canonical statement link
- Repository link

Example citation:

> QuantumKey Protocol (QKP), v1.0 — a protocol for verifiable accountability across autonomous and federated systems.

---

## Website Scope (Minimal)

The official website SHOULD contain only:

- One-page explanation
- Canonical statement
- Links to:
  - Whitepaper
  - Specification
  - SDK repository
  - Conformance

The website is an index, not a duplicate of documentation.

---

## Evolution

Externalization materials may evolve independently, provided that:

- Canonical sources remain unchanged
- Version references are explicit
- Historical claims remain accurate

---

## Statement

Externalization exists to make QKP **discoverable without distortion**.

The protocol speaks through structure and evidence.  
Public materials exist to point to that evidence.
