## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **cost model** for the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) Research Program in 2025.

It maps:
- research activities
- human roles
- software development
- documentation
- testing and validation

to **SIFIDE II eligible cost categories**, enabling tax credit recovery.

This model is forward-compatible with real accounting data.

---

## 2. R&D Roles

The following roles are defined for QKP R&D:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Principal Investigator | Protocol architecture, research direction |
| Cryptography Engineer | Hashing, signatures, canonicalization |
| Protocol Engineer | QIE, chains, aggregates, validation |
| Semantic Systems Engineer | Semantic signatures, evaluation logic |
| SDK Engineer | Implementation of graphs, flows, tests |
| Technical Writer | Specifications, whitepaper, research docs |

These roles correspond to **qualified R&D personnel** under SIFIDE.

---

## 3. Eligible Activities

The following activities are classified as **technological R&D**:

| Activity | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Protocol Design | Formalization of QKP primitives |
| Reference Flow | Executable research flow |
| Conformance Tests | C1–C20 experimental validation |
| SDK Development | Implementation of novel architectures |
| Security Modeling | Threat model & invariants |
| Technical Documentation | Normative and scientific texts |

---

## 4. Cost Categories (SIFIDE)

SIFIDE allows the following eligible cost categories:

| Category | QKP Mapping |
|--------|-------------|
| Personnel | All R&D roles above |
| Software | Dev tools, cryptographic libraries, modeling tools |
| Cloud & Compute | Test execution, simulation, CI |
| Subcontracting | Academic or cryptographic consultation |
| IP & Documentation | Specifications, whitepaper, research outputs |

---

## 5. Cost Units (Template)

This table will be filled with real data from accounting:

| Category | Unit | Rate (€) | Quantity | Total |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-------|
| PI Time | Hour |  |  |  |
| Engineer Time | Hour |  |  |  |
| Software Licenses | Month |  |  |  |
| Cloud Compute | Month |  |  |  |
| Subcontractors | Invoice |  |  |  |

---

## 6. SIFIDE Credit Mapping

SIFIDE allows:

- **32.5%** base credit on all eligible R&D costs  
- **50%** incremental credit on increase vs prior years  
- Maximum incremental cap approx **€1.5M**

Example:

| Eligible R&D Spend | Credit |
|------------------|--------|
| €100,000 | €32,500 (base) |
| Increase of €50,000 | €25,000 (incremental) |
| **Total Credit** | **€57,500** |

This credit offsets IRC and can be carried forward.

---

## 7. Link to Research Evidence

Every cost item must map to:

- `docs/QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md`
- `docs/QKP_R&D_DOSSIER_SIFIDE_2025.md`
- `qkp-sdk/examples/`
- `qkp-sdk/src/`

These documents form the technical justification.

---

## 8. Audit Readiness

To support ANI audits, the following must be kept:

- Timesheets per role
- Technical reports (these docs)
- GitHub commit history
- Invoices and contracts
- CI logs & test runs

This document defines how they map.

---

## 9. Conclusion

This cost model ensures that QuantumKey Protocol’s research work is:

- financially traceable
- legally defensible
- maximally eligible under SIFIDE II

It transforms scientific effort into recoverable capital.
