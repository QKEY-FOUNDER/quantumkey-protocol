# QKP Intention Format — v0.1

Version: v0.1  
Status: Normative  
Scope: Anchor Layer  
Applies to: Ethereum L1 Anchoring  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the canonical format for a **QuantumKey Protocol Intention (QKP-INT)**.

A QKP-INT is a cryptographically signed declaration of future or present intent,
capable of being anchored on Ethereum and verified forever.

This format is normative for QKP Anchor Layer v0.1.

---

## 2. Ontological Definition

A QKP Intention is:

“A commitment made by a sovereign identity to a future-relevant statement or action, anchored in time and provable in perpetuity.”

An intention is not:
- an execution
- a transaction
- a policy
- a promise to a third party

It is a commitment to reality.

---

## 3. Canonical Record Format

A QKP-INT is represented as a signed canonical record:

QKP-INT  
version = 0.1  
qkp_id = did:qkp:…  
intent_id = unique-identifier  
intent_type = semantic-category  
payload_hash = keccak256-hash  
valid_from = ISO-8601 timestamp  
valid_until = ISO-8601 timestamp  
nonce = uint64  
signature = cryptographic-signature  

---

## 4. Field Semantics

version  
QKP-INT specification version  

qkp_id  
Sovereign QKP Identity issuing the intent  

intent_id  
Unique identifier for this intention  

intent_type  
Semantic category of the intention  

payload_hash  
Keccak256 hash of the full semantic payload  

valid_from  
Earliest moment the intention becomes valid  

valid_until  
Expiry moment of the intention  

nonce  
Replay-protection counter  

signature  
Signature over all above fields  

---

## 5. Hashing Rule

The Ethereum anchor stores:

keccak256( canonical_serialization_of_QKP-INT_without_signature )

This value is the **intention commitment hash**.

---

## 6. Signature Rule

The signature must be generated by the private key currently bound to qkp_id
in the QKPIdentityRegistry.

---

## 7. Payload Model

The payload itself is never stored on Ethereum.

Only its hash is anchored.

The payload may contain:
- natural language
- machine instructions
- legal text
- AI prompts
- contracts
- any future data structure

If the hash matches payload_hash, the intention is the same.

---

## 8. Validity Conditions

An intention is valid if:
- its signature is correct  
- the issuer identity is active  
- the timestamp is within valid_from and valid_until  
- the nonce has not been reused  

---

## 9. Ontological Guarantees

Once a QKP-INT hash is anchored:

- the issuer cannot deny having committed it  
- the payload cannot be altered without detection  
- the time of commitment is globally provable  

This creates cryptographic memory.

---

## 10. Relation to Execution

Execution happens elsewhere (L2, agents, humans).

The QKP-INT only states:

“I have committed to this.”

All disputes later refer back to this object.

---

## 11. Versioning

Future versions may extend this format.

Version 0.1 will remain valid and verifiable forever.

---

## 12. Final Statement

A QKP-INT is not a transaction.

It is a moment of truth crystallized into cryptography.
