## 1. Purpose

This document identifies **strategic partnership targets** for the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) and its first pilot project, the **Semantic Accountability Engine (SAE)**.

These partners are selected for their ability to:
- validate research
- host pilots
- co-author funding proposals
- provide institutional legitimacy

---

## 2. Partner Categories

QKP requires four types of partners:

| Category | Role |
|--------|------|
| Academic | Scientific validation & publications |
| Research Institutes | Applied cryptography & distributed systems |
| NGI Ecosystem | European digital commons funding |
| Pilot Hosts | Real-world test environments |

---

## 3. Academic Targets

These universities align with QKP’s scope:

- Universidade de Lisboa (LASIGE, INESC-ID)
- Universidade do Porto (INESC TEC)
- KU Leuven
- TU Delft
- ETH Zurich
- University of Edinburgh
- Sorbonne Université

These institutions specialize in:
- cryptography
- distributed systems
- AI governance

---

## 4. Research Institutes

Institutes with direct relevance:

- INESC-ID (Portugal)
- INESC TEC
- Fraunhofer (Germany)
- TNO (Netherlands)
- CWI (Netherlands)
- NIST (US, for standards dialogue)
- Alan Turing Institute (UK)

---

## 5. NGI & European Programs

Primary funding and ecosystem targets:

- NLnet Foundation (NGI Zero)
- NGI TrustChain
- NGI Assure
- Horizon Europe (Cluster 4: Digital, Industry, Space)
- EIC Pathfinder (deep-tech)

---

## 6. Pilot Hosts

Organizations that could host SAE pilots:

- European research clouds
- public sector AI labs
- digital identity consortia
- open-source foundations
- blockchain foundations

Examples:
- Gaia-X
- EBSI
- Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust
- Hyperledger Labs

---

## 7. Why These Partners

These organizations:
- already work on trust, identity, and governance
- need accountability for autonomous systems
- are funded to adopt open digital infrastructure

QKP offers them:
- a missing layer
- a research-grade solution
- a public good

---

## 8. Engagement Strategy

Partnerships will be pursued via:

- co-authored grant proposals
- pilot hosting agreements
- joint research publications
- open-source collaboration

This ensures:
- legitimacy
- funding leverage
- real-world validation

---

## 9. Final Note

QuantumKey Protocol does not need to convince the world.

It needs to align with the institutions that already exist to build it.

This map shows where to start.
