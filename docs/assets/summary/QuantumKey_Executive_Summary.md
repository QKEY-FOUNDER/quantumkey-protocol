# QuantumKey — Executive Summary

**One line:** QuantumKey is a unified architecture that harmonizes conscious human intent with machine intelligence through a decentralized set of protocols, identity primitives and governance mechanisms.

## Abstract
QuantumKey proposes a practical and philosophical system to align digital structures and AI behavior with human intentions. It combines three interlinked domains — *fields* (QFT), *consciousness*, and *structures* (GR) — into a modular stack that supports identity continuity, tokenized alignment incentives, and decentralized governance. The system is designed to be auditable, upgradeable, and to enable cooperative decision-making between humans and intelligent agents.

## Core value proposition
- **Alignment through architecture:** provide primitives (identity, attestations, intent envelopes) that make human intent machine-readable and verifiable while preserving agency and privacy.  
- **Incentive coherence:** use tokenomics and economic design to reward alignment-preserving behaviour and discourage capture or perverse incentives.  
- **Governance + upgrade path:** a DAO model that enables community-driven specification updates, dispute resolution and restorative justice mechanisms.

## Key components
1. **Identity layer** — persistent, privacy-preserving identity anchors that map human agents and agents’ capabilities.  
2. **Protocol layer** — standardized message envelopes, intent primitives and validation rules enabling interoperable intent exchange.  
3. **Economy layer** — $QKEY token model designed to align incentives, fund public goods, and bootstrap trustworthy validators.  
4. **DAO & governance** — multi-stakeholder governance with proposal, review, and restorative processes.

## Use cases (short)
- Responsible on-chain coordination for mixed human/AI taskforces.  
- Audit trails for AI decisions (for accountability & dispute resolution).  
- Marketplaces for verified human intent and verified skill contributions.

## Call to action
QuantumKey is ready to enter prototype and community review. Next steps: finalize SPEC documents, launch testnet primitives, and open governance for early contributors.
