## 1. Purpose

This dossier documents the **Research & Development (R&D)** activities carried out under the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) during the fiscal year 2025 for the purpose of eligibility under **SIFIDE II** (Portugal).

Its goal is to demonstrate that QKP constitutes **qualifying technological R&D**, involving:
- scientific and technical uncertainty
- experimental development
- creation of novel software and cryptographic architectures
- systematic validation and iteration

This document is structured to be audit-ready for ANI or any competent authority.

## 2. Project Overview

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is a research-driven protocol for **verifiable accountability across autonomous and federated systems**.

The research objective is to design and validate a new class of digital infrastructure where:
- intent is cryptographically formalized
- identity is continuous and verifiable
- causality is explicit
- trust decisions are attestable and policy-scoped

This involves advances in:
- cryptography
- distributed systems
- formal verification
- semantic modeling
- federated trust architectures

These domains intersect in ways not covered by existing standards or platforms.

## 3. Scientific & Technical Uncertainty

At the beginning of 2025, the following core uncertainties existed:

### U1 — Can human and machine intent be represented in a cryptographically canonical form?
No existing protocol provided a deterministic, verifiable, and semantically stable representation of intent.

### U2 — Can accountability be separated from trust?
Existing systems conflate cryptographic validity with acceptance, making federated governance impossible.

### U3 — Can causality be preserved across aggregation layers?
It was unknown whether multi-level aggregation (windowed, hierarchical, federated) could preserve semantic integrity.

### U4 — Can semantic evaluation be bound to cryptographic artifacts?
No proven method existed to attach AI-based semantic judgments to cryptographically verifiable structures.

These uncertainties are non-trivial and constitute genuine R&D risk.

## 4. Research Methodology

The QKP research program follows an experimental and iterative methodology:

1. Formal definition of protocol primitives  
2. Construction of canonical data structures  
3. Implementation of executable reference flows  
4. Design of conformance tests (C1–C20)  
5. Empirical verification through deterministic replay  
6. Continuous falsification of assumptions  

The **Reference Flow** and **Conformance Suite** act as scientific instruments, not products.

## 5. Experimental Work Performed in 2025

The following experimental artifacts were created and iterated:

- Quantum Intent Envelope (QIE) format
- Semantic Signature structures
- Acceptance Receipt model
- Threat Model
- Security Invariants
- Conformance Matrix (C1–C20)
- Executable Reference Flow
- SDK implementing causal graphs, chains and aggregation

These were not derived from existing products — they were created to explore unresolved technical problems.

---

## 6. Technological Advance Beyond State of the Art

QKP advances the state of the art by introducing:

- cryptographically bound intent
- semantic signatures as first-class protocol objects
- attested trust decisions
- causal accountability graphs
- federated aggregation without consensus

No mainstream blockchain, SSI framework, or governance system provides this combination.

---

## 7. Systematic Validation

Each hypothesis is validated by:

- deterministic canonicalization
- cryptographic verification
- conformance tests
- replayable audit flows

This satisfies the SIFIDE definition of **experimental development**.

---

## 8. Eligible Cost Categories (Conceptual)

The following categories are directly tied to the R&D program:

- Research engineering (protocol design, cryptography)
- Software development (SDK, conformance suite)
- Technical documentation (specifications, whitepaper, research program)
- Testing & validation infrastructure

These map to SIFIDE-eligible software and engineering R&D.

---

## 9. Audit Trail

The following documents constitute the scientific audit trail:

- `docs/QKP_RESEARCH_PROGRAM_v0.1.md`
- `docs/REFERENCE_FLOW_v0.1.md`
- `docs/CONFORMANCE_MATRIX_v0.1.md`
- `docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS_v0.1.md`
- `docs/THREAT_MODEL_v0.1.md`
- `qkp-sdk/examples/`
- `qkp-sdk/src/`

Together they form a reproducible record of experimental work.

---

## 10. Conclusion

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) in 2025 qualifies as **technological R&D** under SIFIDE II because it:

- addresses unresolved technical problems
- involves real scientific and engineering uncertainty
- uses experimental and systematic methods
- produces novel, non-obvious results
- generates verifiable technical artifacts

This dossier exists to make that fact explicit, auditable, and defensible.
