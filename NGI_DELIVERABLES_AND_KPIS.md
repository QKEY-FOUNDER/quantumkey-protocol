# NGI Zero — Deliverables, KPIs and Technology Readiness  
**QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**

---

## 1. Current Technology Readiness

QuantumKey Protocol currently stands at **TRL 3–4**.

This is evidenced by:
- A complete normative protocol specification
- A frozen academic baseline (v0.1)
- A working reference SDK implementing all core primitives
- A conformance test suite (C1–C20)
- An executable end-to-end reference flow

However:
- Reproducibility by third parties is not yet validated
- Security hardening and threat-driven testing is incomplete
- Developer-facing documentation is not yet sufficient for independent adoption

NGI Zero funding is used to move QKP to **TRL 5**.

## 2. NGI-Funded Deliverables

### D1 — Reproducible Reference Implementation
We will produce:
- A clean, documented reference implementation of the QKP flow
- One-command execution of the full intent → semantic → trust → audit pipeline
- Deterministic outputs matching the normative examples

**KPI**
- Independent developer can reproduce the end-to-end flow within 30 minutes

---

### D2 — Conformance & Security Hardening
We will:
- Expand the C1–C20 conformance suite
- Add security invariant tests (replay, TTL, causal integrity, mode enforcement)
- Provide failure-mode demonstrations

**KPI**
- ≥ 95% conformance matrix coverage
- All SECURITY_INVARIANTS_v0.1 provably enforced

---

### D3 — Developer Adoption Kit
We will deliver:
- Step-by-step developer onboarding
- Architecture diagrams
- Protocol walkthroughs
- Minimal integration examples

**KPI**
- At least 3 independent implementers can build a compatible QKP flow

---

### D4 — Academic & Institutional Package
We will publish:
- Finalized whitepaper
- Implementation guide
- Audit guide
- Reproducibility instructions

All with stable versioning and citation anchors.

**KPI**
- QKP is citable and reproducible by academic and regulatory reviewers

---

## 3. Value for Money

NGI funding is used exclusively to convert a fully specified protocol into:
- a reproducible digital public good
- an auditable trust infrastructure
- a foundation for European AI, governance and interoperability systems

No funding is used for:
- marketing
- token issuance
- speculation
- platform building

All outputs are open and reusable.

## 4. Why NGI is a Perfect Fit

QuantumKey Protocol directly supports:
- Open Internet infrastructure
- Trust without centralization
- Interoperability across domains
- Accountability for AI systems
- Public-interest digital commons

NGI Zero funding turns QKP from a powerful specification into a **usable European public good**.
