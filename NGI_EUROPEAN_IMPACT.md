# NGI Zero — European Impact & Digital Commons  
**QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**

---

## 1. Why QuantumKey Matters for Europe

Europe depends on digital systems that must be:
- trustworthy
- auditable
- sovereign
- compliant
- interoperable

Yet today, Europe relies on opaque platforms, proprietary clouds, and unaccountable AI and data pipelines.

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) provides a European-grade alternative:

A **public, open, verifiable accountability layer** for:
- AI systems
- digital public services
- federated infrastructures
- cross-border governance
- open-source ecosystems

It gives Europe something it currently lacks:
> a way to prove what happened, who decided, and under which rules — without trusting a platform.

---

## 2. QKP as Digital Public Infrastructure

QKP is not a product.
It is a **public protocol**.

Like:
- TCP/IP
- TLS
- DNS
- public key cryptography

QKP becomes:
- a shared layer
- a public good
- a foundation for many ecosystems

Anyone can build on it.
No one owns it.

## 3. Open by Design

All outputs of this NGI-funded work are:

- open source (code)
- open standards (specifications)
- open data (test vectors, conformance)
- open science (Zenodo DOI)

No part of QKP becomes proprietary.

This ensures:
- vendor neutrality
- long-term European control
- reproducibility
- legal and academic defensibility

---

## 4. Strategic Impact Areas

QKP directly supports:

### European AI Act
By making:
- intent
- authorization
- decisions
- validation
- trust

cryptographically auditable.

### Digital Sovereignty
By enabling:
- federated systems
- cross-border accountability
- independent verification

### Open Internet & NGI Vision
By providing:
- a neutral accountability substrate
- no platform lock-in
- no centralized authority

## 5. Who Benefits

QKP empowers:

- European researchers
- open-source communities
- public administrations
- AI developers
- regulators
- citizens

Everyone gains:
- verifiable truth
- explicit responsibility
- accountable automation

---

## 6. Why NGI Zero Is the Right Home

NGI Zero funds:
- internet commons
- foundational technologies
- open infrastructure

QKP is exactly that.

It does not compete with companies.
It enables them.

It does not centralize.
It federates.

It does not extract value.
It creates shared infrastructure.

---

## 7. Long-Term European Advantage

If Europe controls:
- how intent is expressed
- how AI is evaluated
- how decisions are attested

then Europe controls:
- digital trust
- digital rights
- digital governance

QKP gives Europe this control — without owning platforms.

It owns the protocol.
