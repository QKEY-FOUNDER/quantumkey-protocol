# NGI Zero — TRL & Delivery Roadmap  
**QuantumKey Protocol (QKP)**

---

## 1. Current Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

QuantumKey Protocol is currently at:

**TRL 3–4 — Experimental proof of concept**

This is justified by:
- A complete protocol specification (Baseline v0.1)
- Canonical data structures (QIE, Semantic Signatures, Acceptance Receipts)
- A full end-to-end reference flow
- An executable SDK with conformance tests (C1–C20)
- Academic anchoring via Zenodo DOI

What exists today:
- The protocol is formally defined
- The primitives are implemented
- The behavior is executable
- The system is not yet deployed as a network

This is exactly the maturity level NGI Zero is designed to support.

---

## 2. Target TRL after NGI Zero (12 months)

After the NGI Zero grant period, QKP will reach:

**TRL 6 — System prototype demonstrated in relevant environment**

Meaning:
- A full public testnet exists
- Independent nodes can run the protocol
- End-to-end accountability flows execute in practice
- Third parties can verify, audit, and build on it

---

## 3. What Will Be Delivered

During the NGI Zero funding period, QKP will produce:

### A. Public QKP Testnet
- Multi-node reference implementation
- Public endpoints
- Deterministic replay of accountability flows

### B. Developer-Ready SDK
- Stable API
- Conformance test suite
- Reference flows
- Documentation

### C. Governance & Trust Layer
- Policy engine
- Semantic validator framework
- Acceptance Receipt infrastructure

### D. Audit & Compliance Toolkit
- Tools to:
  - replay decisions
  - verify causal chains
  - validate trust receipts

All outputs will be open source and publicly documented.

## 4. Milestones (12 Months)

| Month | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 1–2  | Testnet architecture + node spec |
| 3–4  | Node implementation (core chain + QIE) |
| 5–6  | Semantic & policy layer integration |
| 7–8  | Federation & aggregation |
| 9–10 | Public testnet + docs |
| 11–12| Audit tools, stabilization, final report |

---

## 5. What Will Be Verifiable

At the end of the project, any reviewer will be able to:

- Run a QKP node
- Submit a QIE
- Obtain Semantic Signatures
- Receive Acceptance Receipts
- Verify everything cryptographically

This moves QKP from:
**“interesting idea” → “operational public infrastructure.”**

---

## 6. Why This Is Low Risk

The hardest part — protocol design — is already done.

NGI Zero funds:
- integration
- engineering
- packaging
- testnet
- developer adoption

Not speculative research.

---

## 7. Why This Is High Leverage

One protocol enables:
- many AI systems
- many governments
- many platforms
- many open-source projects

This is why QKP is ideal for NGI:
it multiplies the value of every euro invested.

---

## 8. Final Statement

QuantumKey Protocol is not a startup bet.
It is a **public infrastructure bet**.

NGI Zero turns a frozen, academically anchored protocol
into a living European digital commons.
