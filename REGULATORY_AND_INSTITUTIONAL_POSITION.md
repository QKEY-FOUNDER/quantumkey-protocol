## 1. Purpose

This document defines the regulatory, academic, and institutional positioning of the QuantumKey Protocol (QKP).

Its purpose is to provide clear, explicit boundaries regarding the nature, scope, and intended use of the protocol, in order to prevent misclassification, regulatory ambiguity, or misinterpretation.

This document is normative for external communication.

## 2. Nature of the Project

QuantumKey Protocol (QKP) is:

- a **protocol specification**
- a **research-driven technical framework**
- an **academic and engineering reference**
- a **verifiable accountability architecture**

QKP is **not**:

- a financial product
- an investment instrument
- a security or derivative
- a commercial service
- an operational blockchain network
- a deployed production system

---

## 3. Current Status

At the time of publication:

- QKP exists as a **formal specification**
- Reference flows and SDK code are **illustrative and non-operational**
- No mainnet, testnet, or production network is live
- No token is issued, sold, or distributed
- No economic activity is enabled

All code and documentation are provided for **research, evaluation, and implementation reference only**.

---

## 4. Academic Positioning

QKP is positioned as:

- an **academic protocol proposal**
- a **normative specification**
- a **research artifact suitable for citation**
- a **baseline for independent implementation**

“The academic baseline is anchored via Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18172464).”

The protocol is anchored via Zenodo with a DOI, ensuring:

- immutability of the academic baseline
- reproducibility of references
- proper scholarly attribution

---

## 5. Regulatory Scope

QKP does not:

- solicit funds
- promise returns
- enable trading
- provide custodial services
- perform brokerage or exchange functions

Accordingly, QKP does **not fall under**:

- financial promotion regulations
- securities issuance frameworks
- consumer investment protection regimes

Any future system derived from QKP would require **independent regulatory analysis** at the time of deployment.

---

## 6. Token Disclaimer

References to tokens, economics, or incentives within QKP documents are:

- conceptual
- architectural
- non-binding

They do not represent:

- an issued asset
- a commitment to issuance
- a sale or offering
- a governance right with monetary value

---

## 7. Forward-Looking Statements

Any forward-looking statements are:

- exploratory
- non-binding
- subject to change
- not commitments

They must not be interpreted as guarantees of future development, deployment, or availability.

---

## 8. Governing Interpretation

This document governs the interpretation of QKP in:

- academic contexts
- institutional reviews
- regulatory discussions
- public communication

In case of ambiguity, this document takes precedence over informal descriptions.

---

## 9. Final Statement

QuantumKey Protocol exists to define **how accountability can be proven**, not to operate a system, sell a product, or issue an asset.

It is a protocol for evidence, not authority.
